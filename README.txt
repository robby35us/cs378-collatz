Comments: I transfered my solution from CS373, which I have been working on most of this week in Downing's other class, over to a c++ implementation. The only file that was actually copied directly was RunCollatz.in.

I attest that I have written every line of code that I have submitted
and I take full responsibility for the origin of all the code submitted.
In particular, if any of the code was originally written in a previous
semester or another course I will so acknowledge via e-mail to the
grader.
